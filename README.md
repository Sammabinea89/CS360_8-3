Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
    
This software had three screens,Â a login screen, a daily weight display screen, and a daily weight entering screen. It was intended to function as a weight-tracking app. This program enables people to create and achieve weight goals. Due to time constraints, I had to cease working on my app, but I completed the idea. The App Release Plan and design are impressive all around.
    
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  
  I created the app's three primary displays to fulfill its technological requirements. These panels had all relevant displays, including the login screen, daily weight screen, and weight entering screen. When the user arrived at the login page, they could either utilize their existing account or create a new one. When someone entered their weight on the Daily Weight screen, a grid appeared for each day. All weight values were entered into this grid. The Weight record page had a basic input box and a save button, allowing users to create new weight records or update existing ones. People can use and comprehend my software since it has few functional pieces and a clean appearance.
    
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

    The information and skills I learned in the ZyBooks component of the course had a significant impact on the code I utilized for my application. This course taught me all I needed to know about creating a database, making accessible buttons, and navigating between panels in Android Studio. Once I've mastered this, I won't hesitate to apply what I've learned to future Android Studio app projects.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

   I made sure that all of my functions worked by running them through the Android Studio emulator. This made sure that the code was right. Carefully test your app to make sure it is safe and good for people to use. Because of this, I learned early on that every comparison I made in my functions always gave me the right data.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

   Using the Android Studio layout tool to build each layout for my app took a lot of time and work because I had to come up with creative ideas all the time. Figuring out how the editor's parts fit together is a different ballgame from actually using it.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

  One of my application's most effective components was the development of a suitable release strategy for my proposal. When I was planning the future monetization and launch of my product, the skills I obtained from prior employment experience in this industry helped me in setting acceptable and successful goals.
